# PHP background management system
An entertainment-oriented PHP single-page background management system. I'll name it: Stitch.
## Introduction
After learning PHP for a few days, I wrote a background management system and realized the management of servers and databases with a single file. It took about two and a half weeks before and after. The first and last time I wrote PHP, it is inevitable to write various problems and loopholes, just take a look at it, don't take it too seriously.
## Function
This background management system provides functions commonly used by administrators.
## ideas
just those ideas
## design
This PHP background management system adopts a minimalist style design, the page is simple and elegant, the layout is clear and organized, including common icons and styles, which conform to user habits and bring fresh feelings.
Originally, I wanted to completely imitate the blue style of the management backstage. Later, when I thought that my friends would vomit when they looked at the backstage every day, let's change the taste.
## Compatible
Compatibility is impossible, my test PHP version is 5.6.30, MySQL 5.6.35, the syntax used is old and new, but some particularly old syntax has been abandoned, browser chrome, monitor 15 inches, server plus Guest OS macOS Sierra 10.12.6, if you're having issues with everything. . . What does it have to do with me.
A lot of content in the front-end part is based on my browser and resolution. The compatibility may become weaker on high-resolution machines and other kernel browsers, but the display part is still as adaptive as possible. It is recommended to use chrome to browse and adjust the window size appropriately for the best look and feel. Because I am too poor to buy a smartphone, I still use the Nokia 1110, so there is no mobile adaptation.
